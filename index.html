    <p>
      When I first started in school I had no idea I had ADHD until 2nd grade
      when I first got to school I had no frenids except for one kid named Jake
      Taylor and he was the nicest kid becuase he showed me around the school
      and he got me used to the school.After second grade I started to make
      frenids and started to get along with the other kids at school. My
      teachers said that with my ADHD it was going to be hard for me to prosess
      the stuff that I am doing for school so at the start of middle school my
      teahcers put me in a class that is for ADHD kids. When I was younger my
      only dream was to be an astronuat and do some enginering in that feild.
      When I went in to high school I had no idea how hard it was was going to
      be but I survied 2 years and now I am in my third year high school only
